<div class='question'>
	What is Zu?
</div>
<div class='answer'>
  
The the app that pays you back for being you.  You get paid for living your life, just like you were already doing, and how ever you will.  Walking around the neighborhood, exploring your neighborhood, and getting local.   Instead of going in circles for nothing, now you can go around and get paid.


</div>
<div class='question'>
	What is a Locale?
</div>
<div class='answer'>
  
Any participating commercial establishment (i.e. a restaurant, cafe, etc…) where you can earn Zus.


</div>
<div class='question'>
	What is a Zu (pronounced “Zoo”)?
</div>
<div class='answer'>
  
This is the hard currency, just like dollars, except they’re attached to a single Locale, as opposed to the government, which, theoretically, is not a commercial enterprise. 


</div>
<div class='question'>
	How can I use my Zus?
</div>
<div class='answer'>
  
Just like your other hard-earned dollars, take them to the store and tell the person taking the transaction you’d like to pay in Zus.


</div>
<div class='question'>
	How can I make some Zus?
</div>
<div class='answer'>
  
With great ease.  Often, just walking by a participating locale is enough to bank a few.  You also make Zus for buying ANYTHING at a Locale, also for simple things like answering a question or two from the Locale, and depending on the Locale, even sharing your thoughts with your friends.


</div>
<div class='question'>
	Where can I use my Zus?
</div>
<div class='answer'>
  
At the place where you earn them.


</div>
<div class='question'>
	Can I trade my Zus for cash?
</div>
<div class='answer'>
  
The IRS would be all over you, so… nope.


</div>
<div class='question'>
	Can I trade my Zus at one place for prizes at another?
</div>
<div class='answer'>
  

	Zus are, indeed, currency.  As with all economics, who can know how the market will develop?
  But at this time, loyalty is King.  You might as well try to use Japanese Yen at a pharmacy in Egypt.
